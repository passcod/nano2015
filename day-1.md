# Day 0

Nano 2015. In a bit less than 12 hours. It's nearly there!

Like every year, I prepare to make my way down to Auckland for the midnight kickoff party. Saf can't make it, she's abroad at a conference, but there'll be Morange, Ren, Rabble, and everyone else, so it will still be fun. And productive! hopefully. But mostly fun. I still have no idea what to do, what to write, or even if I have the motivation to do it. But I'll just drive down and make it to the kickoff for a weekend night of fun and then start it from there. Like last year. And the year before that.

But right now, I'm still at home in Whangarei. To my dear readers who might not know much of the geography of this sweet country I call home: Whangarei is a small city 200km and two hours (our motorways are not quite up to big-country standards) from Auckland, the hub of basically everything in this land. Auckland, pop nearly 2 million, where the sounds of parties can be heard from the rooftops. Whangarei, pop unknown to this author but probably far less, where the only sound you can hear at night is the crickets turning tail and leaving for more busy plains.

You know that background chatter and cars and police sirens that's omnipresent in cities? We don't have that. You know how in big cities you can grab a bite or a pint pretty much everywhere at pretty much any time of day and night? Yeah, we don't have that.

But I love it. I'm weird like that.

At around 1pm, I start manifesting my presence to the Auckland Wrimos in my modest twitter following. I count two to three hours to drive there, find a park, and walk over, so I announce that I'll be there around 5pm... or 6pm, because margins and... well, let's just say I'm not known for punctuality. I just hate driving in Auckland! It's so confusing, nobody indicates, everybody goes too fast, and I'm just a rural kinda person. I like my roads coarse and crunchy, my turns sharp, and my speed never to go above 90k.

Time to take a shower and get dressed. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's afternoon already! But so what. It's the weekend. I can loaf around half naked if I please. Time to get a shower... spend way too much time under the delicious delicious hot water... brush my hair... and then go look for something decent to wear.

Half and hour later, I've got most of my wardrobe strewn over my bed, and it's not looking good. I hesitate between putting on a dress or just going with a t-shirt and slacks (or whatever you call these kinds of pants). I put the dress on. I go close the house, clean a few things, find my keys... lose my keys, find the double, find the first keys, lose the second ones —oh who cares at least I've got keys— and getting ready to leave... only fifteen minutes behind schedule, plenty of time.

Take phone... damn, this dress doesn't have pockets. Remove dress, cram in backpack, put t-shirt on, put jacket on, put phone keys headphones digital-security-keyfob-thingie wallet glasses-wiping-cloth pen pencil and a dash of pocket lint... in pockets, lock the door, unlock the door, check all windows, stay still for five minutes thinking _really_ hard about not having forgotten anything... and leave.

Finally on my way. And just an hour late, `*ahem*` "behind schedule," not too bad.

I put some music on, and start driving. I'm right bang in the middle of my annual "curate a playlist" binge. The way it works is that all year long, between, roughly, December and October, I listen to lots and lots of music, and put all that I like _pelle-mêle_ into a folder. Then I go and listen to _all of it_ once, in alphabetical order, adding nothing new, and sorting the very good or thematic or whatever in the relevant playlists. Currently I'm halfway through P, so about a third to go, or 250-odd songs. Another week, maybe?

Once I've done that, I go through each thus-created or thus-added-to playlist and listen to it entirely, in whatever order it's in. I remove what I don't like anymore, move what belongs elsewhere to its proper place, and other such normal curating things. Finally, _finally!_, I just go and order my playlists in an order that makes them nice to listen to without "random" on, and I export the ordered and curated song list to text (for easy machine parsing so I can recover if ever Spotify dies or I lose access or something else horrible like that). And then it's (probably) December again and I just start the entire process all over again! It's fun.

Oh, look at that! We've, err, _I_'ve reached the Brynderwyn hills. It's full of orange road cones and has a nice sign saying the "Brynderwyn Safety System" is being built. Two years in the making, it's now nearly complete and looks really really neat. It's just nice curves and steel and brand new tarseal, but it's got this quality to it, you can just _feel_ the design seep out from the ground up. It feels real classy to be driving along.

The Hills used to be the most dangerous bit of road between Whangarei and Auckland, and featured 10-metre-tall blue, yellow, and red signs at either end telling you that way too may people killed themeselves in there and you better not be one of them. Now the signs have moved to another place, and the Safety System is there for us. I feel better already.

I'm on top of the hill and there's a weird— my "oil" indicator is on. Off. On. Off. Flickering. On. Flickering. Off. Damn damn damn damn damn I do not need this please be nothing wrong do I even have engine oil in the back I can't see anything through the mirror what do I do I can't stop there noooo... So I slow right down, which is fine as the curves are signed at 35k... 35k curves on a motorway! Only New Zealand. I get down from the Hills and onto a relatively flat and wide section of road, stop on the side, stop the engine, let it cool off. Phew.

Pop the trunk, pop the hood, take piece of cloth, go check the oil levels. Nominal. OK. Deep breath. Everything looks fine. I add a litre of oil, just in case, send a message home, cross metaphorical fingers, and drive off again. Music back on, driving enthusiastically towards words and friends and the actual start of my weekend.

I recently rediscovered Daft Punk. I think I got them mixed up with NIN or some other ancient band? Is Daft Punk the one who released a new album recently (recently being within the last three years) which was quite different from what they did before and people got controversial about it? Or was it another band? I don't know. I don't care. I like Daft Punk.

There's this song by Georgeo (phonetically approximative — or approximatively phonetic) that's just him speaking of his origins as a musician over a track... and then there's silence. And then there's a beat. And he just constructs the music one bit at a time, right before our ears, right there and then, and you can literally hear it all come together, this masterpiece of synth and beat and everything is perfect and it just goes on and on and— _bliss_.

I'm getting close to my goal! Into the tunnel, through the toll portico, flashback to a discussion where someone remarqued how amazing it was that cameras could get your plate number, reliably, for every vehicle, at speeds between 70 and 120k, in the noon sun, the orange dusk, the pale dawn, the black and blue night.

It's only a few kilometres later that tragedy strikes. There's a sound in the engine, a tap tap tap ta-ta-ta ta-ta-tap whenever I push on the gas pedal. It's bad. I can feel the car shuddering in tune. I take the first exit, "Silverdale," take a right, a left, a right, whatever I have to do to get onto a less-traveled road, hopefully a little wider... there: a patch of gravelly road side, I can stop there.

I'm 35km from the nano kickoff party and my car is dead.
